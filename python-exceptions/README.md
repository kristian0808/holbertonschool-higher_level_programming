# Python - Exceptions

This project is a part of the curriculum of Holberton School. It is designed to help students understand the concept of exceptions in Python programming.

## Overview

The project includes several tasks that involve handling exceptions and errors in Python. It covers topics like the difference between errors and exceptions, how to use exceptions, when to use them, how to handle them correctly, and more.

## Tasks

The tasks in this project range from safe list printing, safe printing of integers, division of integers with debug information, division of lists, and raising exceptions with messages.

Each task is a separate Python script file, and they all follow the same basic requirements:

- All scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- All files end with a new line

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the project, you should be able to explain why Python programming is awesome, the difference between errors and exceptions, what exceptions are and how to use them, when we need to use exceptions, how to correctly handle an exception, and more.
